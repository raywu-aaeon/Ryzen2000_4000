PORTING NOTE:

1. Add following codes after ""AaeonCommonPkg\AaeonCommonPkg.cif"= Private" in veb file.
==>>
"AaeonCommonPkg\AaeonDefaultPwd\AaeonDefaultPwd.cif"= Private
<<==

2. Need to add prefix at some special character like #, $ and % (# -> \#, $ -> $$, % -> %%). 
   For example, you want to set the ADMIN password as 2#3$4%5, you have to set is as 2\#3$$4%%5. This the limitation of makefile.
